Algorithm Challenge #30 – Factorial of N
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge focuses on calculating the factorial (N!) of a positive number entered by the user.
The program uses a loop to multiply all integers from N down to 1, while ensuring valid input through a while loop.

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
Implementing loops for repetitive multiplication

Using while loops for input validation

Handling large integer results with long long

Understanding factorial logic and mathematical patterns

🧩 Example
-
Input:
Enter a positive number: 5

Output:
The factorial of 5 is: 120

📂 File Information
-
Language: C++
File Name: factorial_of_n.cpp
Challenge Number: #30

💬 Notes
-
This challenge reinforces how loops and conditional checks can be combined to build reliable mathematical programs.
It’s a key step toward understanding recursion, iteration, and input validation in algorithmic problem-solving.
